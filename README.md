## üìã Integration and Usage

You need to copy the directories : 
`widgets/Gridview_` 
`widgets/Grid_of_Gridviews`

with their files to /lib.

Then use MainGrid widget wrapped with a SingleChildScrollView  where u need it.
Note: 
- You may need to edit the imports in the files.
- You need to pass the below data structure to the 

### üóÇÔ∏è Data Structure for `MainGrid`

The `MainGrid` widget requires a `Map<String, List<Map<String, dynamic>>>`  and a `final  List<String>` data structure to populate its grids. Here's an example format:

```
final Map<String, List<Map<String, dynamic>>> gridItems = {
  "Kitchen": [
    {"name": "Lamp 1", "color": Colors.red, "icon": Icons.lightbulb, "value": true},
    {"name": "Spotlight 1", "color": Colors.orange, "icon": Icons.light, "value": 0.86},
    {"name": "AC 2", "color": Colors.purple, "icon": Icons.ac_unit, "value": true},
    {"name": "Door Lock", "color": Colors.teal, "icon": Icons.lock_outlined, "value": true},
  ],
  "Living Room": [
    {"name": "Heater", "color": Colors.pink, "icon": Icons.air_rounded, "value": true},
    {"name": "Lamp 2", "color": Colors.green, "icon": Icons.lightbulb, "value": true},
    {"name": "Lamp 3", "color": Colors.blue, "icon": Icons.lightbulb, "value": true},
  ],
};

final  List<String> dataKeysIndexs = ["Kitchen" , "Living Room"];
// used to keep the index of keys and to be retrived from the db

```

Each `List<Map<String, dynamic>>` represents the items in a specific room or category:

-   **Key:** A string representing the room(in my use case) or a group name.
-   **Value:** A list of maps, where each map contains:
    -   `name` (String): The device's name.
    -   `icon` (IconData): The icon representing the device.
    -   `state` (bool): The device's initial state (e.g., on/off).

Pass this `gridItems` map to `MainGrid` as follows:


```
MainGrid(gridItems: gridItems)
```
### üíæ Saving changing of order.
The order of the grids and the elements of the grids **is** the indexes  of `List<String> dataKeysIndexs` 
and `List<Map<String, dynamic>>` in `Map<String, List<Map<String, dynamic>>>` respectively.

So applying changing to the backend/Database as these indexes of the elements in Lists changes will allow u to save order for the next time the app starts and retrives the data.
